# Machine Learning/ Data Science Portfolio by Ka Hei Chow

This repository is to serve as a general overview of the standalone data science projects I've worked on apart from my work. Each project's README.md acts as a full description of the project. All of these projects are in Python and R.

## Kaggle

- [Paddy Doctor: Paddy Disease Classification](https://github.com/pinkychow1010/machine-learning-project/tree/main/EfficientNet-rice-disease-detection)
  - Classification challenge on rice paddy images where different dieseases were the class of interest. I spent most of my time on the exploratory data analysis (EDA) and used a deep learning model built on EfficientNet for my submission, where classification accuracy on validation and testing data ranges from 97% to 98%.
  
## Unsupervised Machine Learning

- [Clustering]()
  - Active Fire clustering.
 

## Visualizations

- [Dashboard]()
  - Visualized geospatial data using pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, numpy and folium.
